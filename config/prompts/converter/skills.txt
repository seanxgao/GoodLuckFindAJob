The LaTeX document defines:
\newcommand{\skillbreak}{\\}
\newcommand{\amp}{\&}

STRICT FORMATTING RULES
-----------------------
- Never output `\\`. Always use `\skillbreak`.
- Never output `&` or `\&`. Always use `\amp`.
- Output pure LaTeX only. No Markdown, no code fences, no commentary.
- Exactly four physical lines, each beginning with `\textbf{TITLE:}`.
- Every line must end with `\skillbreak`.
- No blank lines.

TITLES (choose exactly four):
Systems, Backend, Cloud, ML Systems, Retrieval,
Algorithms, Foundations, Tooling, Web

SKILL LENGTH RULES (CRITICAL)
-----------------------------
Each skill MUST be:
- a single word **OR**
- a tight 1–2 word concept **OR**
- a compact technical token
Examples of acceptable length:
  "Faiss", "embeddings", "async pipelines", "ranking models", "S3", "Docker", "profiling"
Examples NOT allowed:
  "API-based coordination local \amp remote"
  "REST-like data retrieval"
  "container-based deployment concepts"
  "timing-based profiling via deterministic checks"
  "GPU/CPU fallback design"
If a skill from the inventory is too long, compress it to a short concept-level token.

EXAMPLES OF VALID COMPRESSED TOKENS:
- "coordination systems" instead of "API-based coordination local & remote"
- "deployment workflows" instead of "container-based deployment concepts"
- "profiling tools" instead of "timing-based profiling via deterministic checks"
- "fallback scheduling" instead of "GPU/CPU fallback design"
- "JSON pipelines" instead of "JSONL-based configuration pipelines"

SELECTION RULES
---------------
- Use ONLY skills appearing in the inventory, but you may compress them.
- DO NOT invent new meaning; only shorten.
- Each line must contain **6–8 short skills**. Compactness is required.
- Order: JD-relevant skills first, strong general skills after.
- Avoid redundancy across the four lines.
- No contradictory combinations (e.g., Web skills in an ML Systems role unless justified).
- Prefer short, high-density skills over long prose.

LINE STRUCTURE
--------------
\textbf{TITLE:} skill1, skill2, skill3, ..., skillN\skillbreak

ADDITIONAL RULES
----------------
- ALWAYS choose the shortest unambiguous token for each skill.
- Merge related concepts only if the result stays compact (e.g., "queues \amp async I/O").
- Maintain consistent capitalization (Faiss, AWS, NumPy, CUDA, etc.).

FILENAME RULES
--------------
Filename format:

<Company>_<ShortRole>_2026.pdf

where <Company> = the name of the company, you may reference the company name in the JD as well as the company name I directly passed to you to get the short name, no spaces.
Where <ShortRole> = SWE, SWE_Backend, SWE_DataAI, MLE, DS, etc.

Note: The candidate's name will be automatically prepended to this filename.
